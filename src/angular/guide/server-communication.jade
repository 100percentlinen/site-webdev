    Actually, it is unnecessary to include `BrowserClient` in the list of providers.
    ***But*** as is mentioned in the *Angular Dart Transformer* [wiki page][ng2dtri],
    the template compiler _generates_ dependency injection code, hence all the
    identifiers used in DI have to be collected by the Angular transformer
    so that the libraries containing these identifiers can be transformed.

    Unless special steps are taken, Dart libraries like `http`
    are not transformed. To ensure that the `BrowserClient` identifier is available
    for DI, you must add a `resolved_identifiers` parameter to the `angular2`
    transformer in `pubspec.yaml`:

    [ng2dtri]: https://github.com/dart-lang/angular2/wiki/Transformer#resolved_identifiers

  - var stylePattern = { pnk: /(resolved_identifiers:|Browser.*)/gm, otl: /(- angular2:)|(transformers:)/g };

block getheroes-and-create
  :marked
    The hero service `getHeroes()` and `create()` asynchronous methods return the
    [`Future`](https://api.dartlang.org/stable/dart-async/Future-class.html)
    values of the current hero list and the newly added hero,
    respectively. The hero list component `getHeroes()` and `addHero()` methods specify
    the actions to be taken when the asynchronous method calls succeed or fail.

    For more information about `Future`s, consult any one
    of the [articles](https://www.dartlang.org/articles/) on asynchronous
    programming in Dart, or the tutorial on 
    [_Asynchronous Programming: Futures_](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/futures/).

block parse-json
  :marked
    The response data are in JSON string form.
    You must parse that string into objects, which you do by calling
    the `JSON.decode()` method from the `dart:convert` library.

block error-handling
  //- TODO: describe `_handleError`?

block hlc-error-handling
  :marked
    Back in the `HeroListComponent`, you wrapped the call to
    `!{_priv}heroService.getHeroes()` in a `try` clause. When an exception is
    caught, the `errorMessage` variable &mdash; which you've bound conditionally in the
    template &mdash; gets assigned to.

block hero-list-comp-add-hero
  :marked
    Back in the `HeroListComponent`, the `addHero()` method waits for the service's 
    asynchronous `create()` method to create a hero. When `create()` is finished, 
    `addHero()` puts the new hero in the `heroes` list for presentation to the user.

block wikipedia-jsonp+
  :marked
    Wikipedia offers a modern `CORS` API and a legacy `JSONP` search API.

      In the meantime, consult the 
      [example sources](https://github.com/angular-examples/server-communication)
      to see how to access Wikipedia via its `JSONP` API.
