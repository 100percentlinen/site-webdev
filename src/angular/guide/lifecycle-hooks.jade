    The router, for instance, also has its own [router lifecycle
    hooks](router.html#router-lifecycle-hooks) that allow us to tap into
    specific moments in route navigation.
    A parallel can be drawn between `ngOnInit` and `routerOnActivate`.  Both are
    prefixed so as to avoid collision, and both run right when a component is
    being initialized.
