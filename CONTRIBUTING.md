# Contributing :green_heart:

Thanks for thinking about helping with [webdev.dartlang.org][webdev]!
Here are a couple of ways that you can contribute:

* [Report issues](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-webdev/issues/new).
* Fix issues (especially ones with the label
  **[help wanted](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-webdev/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22%20)**).
  * If this is your first contribution—_welcome!_—please
  [sign the CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual)
  and check out issues that are 
  labeled **[beginner](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-webdev/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22%20label%3Abeginner%20)**.
  Beginner issues may or may not be easy to fix.
  Sometimes they're issues we don't have the expertise to fix ourselves,
  and we'd love to work with a contributor who has the right skills.
  * We use the usual [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process.
  * We follow the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/).

To avoid wasting your time, talk with us before you make any nontrivial
pull request. The [issue tracker](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-webdev/issues)
is a good way to track your progress publicly, but we can also communicate
other ways such as email and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/dart-lang/home).

## Tips

* To find the file corresponding to a page, search this repo for a section title
  (or any other phrase) that seems unique. For example, to find the source file for
  https://webdev.dartlang.org/guides/get-started, you can
  [search for "play with dartpad"](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-webdev/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22play+with+dartpad%22&type=). The single result is
  `src/_guides/get-started.md`.
* Unless you love a challenge, avoid issues labeled
  [Infrastructure](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-webdev/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AInfrastructure).
  They tend to be complicated.
